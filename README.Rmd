## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("GregorDeCillia/showdown")
```

## Usage

Use `show_file` to include the contents of a file. The syntx highlighting is
chosen based on the file extension.

```{r}
library(showdown)
show_file("R/show_file.R")
```

The parameter `lang` can be used to manually set the syntax highlighter.

```{r}
show_file("DESCRIPTION", language = "yaml")
```

To show the contanents of a file from GitHub, `show_file_github` can be used.

```{r}
show_file_github(repo = "statistikat/surveysd", file = "src/compute_linear.cpp")
```
